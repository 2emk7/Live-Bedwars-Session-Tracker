Session stats tracker for Hypixel Bedwars

The current release doesnt work as I built it using my latest.log path. I will eventually fix it.

You can manually fix it yourself by going into getstats.py and replacing my path to latest.log to yours. then in command prompt do cd <folder the project is in> and then pyinstaller --onefile --noconsole --hidden-import=PySide6.QtCore --hidden-import=PySide6.QtGui --hidden-import=PySide6.QtWidgets main.py
